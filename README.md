# Neural Network in Rust
This repository contains the implementation of a simple neural network in Rust, along with parallel versions and a comparison with a Python version using TensorFlow. The network is trained on the MNIST dataset for digit recognition.

# Features
Implemented from scratch in Rust: Gain a deep understanding of neural network architecture and training algorithms.

Simple and parallel versions: Compare the performance of different implementations.

Comparison with TensorFlow: See how the Rust implementation performs against a popular deep-learning library.

The simple version of the neural network achieved the fastest training time, followed by TensorFlow and the parallel versions. This was surprising, as the parallel versions were expected to be faster due to their ability to utilize multiple CPU cores.
